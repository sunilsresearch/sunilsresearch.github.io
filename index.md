<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1><tab1>Welcome to my homepage. I’m <strong>Dr. Sunil Paul Mathew Menacherry</strong>, a researcher originally from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala" target="_blank">Kerala</a>—a southern state of India often celebrated for its natural beauty. I currently work as a Scientist at the <a href="https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en" target="_blank">German Environment Agency (UBA)</a> in Berlin, Germany.</tab1></tab1></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1><tab1>With over a decade of experience in Chemistry and Environmental Sciences, my research spans a range of disciplines including Analytical Chemistry (such as chromatography and mass spectrometry), Physical Chemistry (reaction mechanisms and kinetics), and Environmental Chemistry (pollutant screening and removal).</tab1></tab1></p>
