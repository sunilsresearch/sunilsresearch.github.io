<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>Welcome to my homepage. I am <strong>Dr. Sunil</strong>, a researcher who was born and brought up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala" target="_blank">Kerala</a>, a southern state of India which is considered by many as one of the most beautiful places on this planet. I am currently working at the <a href="https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en" target="_blank">German Environment Agency (UBA)</a> as a Scientific Assistant. I have been working on various aspects of Chemistry and Environmental Sciences for the past decade. I have strong research interests in Analytical Chemistry (e.g. chromatography and mass spectrometry), Physical Chemistry (e.g. reaction mechanism and kinetics), Environmental chemistry (e.g. screening and removal of pollutants) etc.</tab1></p>

# Research Interests

* Structural elucidation of metabolites/degradation products of organic pollutants.
* Characterization of isomeric compounds by Energy-Resolved Mass Spectrometry.
* Trace level detection of organic pollutants by tandem Mass Spectrometry.
* Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) for the degradation of organic pollutants from water.
