<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1><strong>Dr. Sunil</strong> is an experienced analytical and environmental chemist presently (from August 2023) associated with the research group of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u7n2nsIAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Aki Sebastian Ruhl</a> at the German Environment Agency (UBA), Berlin, Germany, as a Scientific Assistant. As a part of the Drinking Water Resources and Treatment section of UBA, he is mainly involved in the development of analytical strategies for the analysis of pharmaceuticals and other emerging organic contaminants for their detection from water.</tab1></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>Dr. Sunil's enthusiasm for analytical chemistry started when he joined as a trainee analyst at the Quality Evaluation Laboratory of the <a href="http://www.indianspices.com" target="_blank">Spices Board of India</a> (Kochi, Kerala) immediately after completing his Master's degree from <a href="https://www.mgu.ac.in" target="_blank">Mahatma Gandhi University</a>, Kottayam (2008). During this tenure in spices board, he was involved in the analysis of various spices and spice products for different quality parameters. This work involves the use of highly sophisticated analytical instrumentation techniques, such as the High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Gas Chromatography (GC), Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS), Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), etc. In 2010, he joined as a project fellow (funded by UGC-DAE CSR, Kolkata) in the group of <a href="http://www.ctamgu.in/home/" target="_blank">Prof. C. T. Aravindakumar</a> (School of Environmental Sciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam) after a national level interview. Later (2011), he became a Ph.D. student in the same institute.</tab1></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>Broad research interests of Dr. Sunil include analytical chemistry, free radical chemistry, environmental chemistry etc. During the initial stage of Ph.D., he was mainly focused on the mechanistic investigations of environmentally and biologically relevant molecules (mainly pharmaceuticals and personnel care products: PPCPs) by free radical reactions. Some of his works in this area include kinetic and mechanistic investigations on the oxidative transformation of Theophylline (<a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/-/content/articlehtml/2014/ob/c4ob00102h" target="_blank">Org. Biomol. Chem., 2014</a>), Diphenhydramine (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/slct.201600103/abstract" target="_blank">ChemistrySelect, 2016</a>), Fensulfothion (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653512014385?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">Chemosphere, 2013</a>), etc. These works involves the extensive use of time-resolved spectroscopic techniques as well as various chromatographic and mass spectrometric techniques to elucidate unknown transformation products. In 2014, his work in this area was selected for “Dr. Hari Mohan memorial award” for the best poster in Trombay Symposium on Radiation and Photochemistry (TSRP 2014) held on January 6-9, 2014 at Mumbai, India. A few months later (October 2014), <a href="http://www.csir.res.in" target="_blank">Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)</a>, Govt. of India, awarded him with Senior Research Fellowship (SRF).</tab1></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>Dr. Sunil was also involved in several collaborative research programs conducted by Prof. Aravindakumar’s group. Examples include the collaborative studies conducted with <a href="http://pagesperso.lcp.u-psud.fr/belloni/" target="_blank">Prof. Jacqueline Belloni</a> of Université Paris-Sud, Orsay, France (<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/09553002.2014.899451" target="_blank">Int. J. Radiat. Biol., 2014</a>) and <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=CwkZd7AAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Mehmet A. Oturan</a> of Université Gustave Eiffel, Marne-la-Vallée, France (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-014-2772-4" target="_blank">Environ. Sci. Pollut. Res., 2014</a>; <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11356-017-9309-6" target="_blank">Environ. Sci. Pollut. Res., 2017</a>). His contributions to the above-mentioned studies were mainly on the structural elucidation of the transformation products derived from biologically important molecules, such as hydroxy naphthoquinones, amino salicylic acids etc. Later, he collaborated with <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=08XXzuEAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Olivier Laprévote</a> of Université Paris Cité, Paris, France to develop an advanced mass spectrometry-based methodology to characterize position isomers formed during the oxidative transformation of an environmentally relevant bio-molecule, diphenhydramine (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jms.3607/full" target="_blank">J. Mass Spectrom., 2015</a>).</tab1></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>The last part of his PhD research mainly involves investigations on environmentally relevant transformations in ice phase. This research has been conducted in <a href="http://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/" target="_blank">Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH)</a>, Republic of Korea, where he was associated with the research group of <a href="https://epa.kentech.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Prof. Wonyong Choi</a> (Presently associated with the <a href="https://www.kentech.ac.kr/main.do" target="_blank">Korea Institute of Energy Technology (KENTECH)</a> as a distinguished professor; also, the Editor-in-Chief of <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/journal/aeecco" target="_blank">ACS ES&T Engineering</a>) as an international visiting student (2014-15). In September 2015, Dr. Sunil joined as a Post-Doctoral Researcher in the same group with an aim to continue his work in ice chemistry. During this period, he was mainly engaged with investigating the dissolution of environmentally relevant inorganic ions, such as Lead (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.121298" target="_blank">J. Hazard. Mater., 2020</a>), Iron (<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.8b04484" target="_blank">Environ. Sci.

His attention has been also gone to the dark phase production of hydrogen peroxide as well as humic-like substances in ice, which are considered as extremely important in the environment.</tab1></p>
