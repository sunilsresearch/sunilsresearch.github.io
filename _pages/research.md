# Research

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1><strong>Dr. Sunil</strong> is presently (from August 2023) associated with the research group of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u7n2nsIAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Aki Sebastian Ruhl</a> at the German Environment Agency (UBA, Berlin, Germany, as a Scientific Assistant. He received his Bachelor (Chemistry) and Master (Pharmaceutical chemistry) degrees from <a href="https://www.mgu.ac.in" target="_blank">Mahatma Gandhi University</a>, Kottayam in 2006 and 2008 respectively. He joined <a href="http://www.indianspices.com" target="_blank">Spices Board of India</a>, Kochi, Kerala, as a trainee analyst immediately after receiving the master degree. During this tenure in spices board, he was involved in the analysis of various spices and spice products for different quality parameters. This work involves the use of highly sophisticated analytical instrumentation techniques, such as the High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Gas Chromatography (GC), Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS), Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), etc. He joined as a project fellow (funded by UGC-DAE CSR, Kolkata) in the group of <a href="http://www.ctamgu.in/home/" target="_blank">Prof. C. T. Aravindakumar</a> (School of Environmental Sciences, Mahatma Gandhi University, Kottayam) after a national level interview (2010). Later (2011), he became a Ph.D. student in the same institute.</tab1></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>Broad research interests of Dr. Sunil include analytical chemistry, free radical chemistry, environmental chemistry etc. During the initial stage of Ph.D., he was mainly focused on the mechanistic investigations of environmentally and biologically relevant molecules (mainly Pharmaceutical and Personnel care products: PPCPs) by free radical reactions. Some of his works in this area include kinetic and mechanistic investigations on the oxidative transformation of Theophylline (<a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/-/content/articlehtml/2014/ob/c4ob00102h" target="_blank">Organic &amp; Biomolecular Chemistry 2014</a>), Diphenhydramine (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/slct.201600103/abstract" target="_blank">ChemistrySelect, 2016</a>), Fensulfothion (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653512014385?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">Chemosphere, 2013</a>), etc. These works involves the extensive use of time-resolved spectroscopic techniques as well as various chromatographic and mass spectrometric techniques to elucidate unknown transformation products. In 2014, his work in this area was selected for “Dr. Hari Mohan memorial award” for the best poster in Trombay Symposium on Radiation and Photochemistry (TSRP 2014) held on January 6-9, 2014 at Mumbai, India. A few months later (October 2014), <a href="http://www.csir.res.in" target="_blank">Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)</a>, Govt. of India, awarded him with Senior Research Fellowship (SRF).</tab1></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>Dr. Sunil was also been involved in several collaborative research programs of Prof. Aravindakumar’s group with <a href="http://pagesperso.lcp.u-psud.fr/belloni/" target="_blank">Prof. J. Belloni</a> of Université Paris-Sud, Orsay, France (<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/09553002.2014.899451" target="_blank">International Journal of Radiation Biology, 2014</a>) and <a href="http://lge.u-pem.fr/organisation-et-personnel/personnel/oturan-mehmet-ali/" target="_blank">Prof. M. A. Oturan</a> of Université Paris-Est, Marne-la-Vallée, France (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-014-2772-4" target="_blank">Environ. Sci. Pollut.

Res., 2017</a>), where his contributions were mainly on the structural elucidation of the transformation products derived from biologically important molecules (e.g. hydroxy naphthoquinones, Amino salicylic acids etc.). Later, he collaborated with Prof. Olivier Laprévote of Université Paris Cité, Paris, France to develop an advanced mass spectrometry-based methodology to characterize position isomers formed during the oxidative transformation of an environmentally relevant molecule, diphenhydramine (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jms.3607/full" target="_blank">J. Mass Spectrom., 2015</a>).</tab1></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>The last part of his PhD research mainly involves the investigation on environmentally relevant transformations in ice phase. This research has been conducted in <a href="http://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/" target="_blank">(Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH)</a>, Republic of Korea, where he was associated with the research group of <a href="https://epa.kentech.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Prof. Wonyong Choi</a> (Presently associated with the <a href="https://www.kentech.ac.kr/main.do" target="_blank">Korea Institute of Energy Technology (KENTECH)</a> as a distinguished professor; also, the Editor-in-Chief of <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/journal/aeecco" target="_blank">ACS ES&T Engineering</a>) as an international visiting student (2014-15). In September 2015, Dr. Sunil joined as a Post-Doctoral Researcher in the same group with an aim to continue his work in ice chemistry. During this period, he was mainly engaged with investigating the dissolution of environmentally relevant ions, such as Lead (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.121298" target="_blank">J. Hazard. Mater., 2020</a>), Iron (<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.8b04484" target="_blank">Environ. Sci.

His attention has been also gone to the dark phase production of hydrogen peroxide as well as humic-like substances in ice, which are considered as extremely important in the environment. In October 2019, Dr. Sunil joined as a Post-Doctoral Researcher in the Department of Soil Science and Soil Protection, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (CULS), Czech Republic (Supervisor: <a href="https://home.czu.cz/en/kodesova/home" target="_blank">Prof. Radka Kodešová</a>), where his research mainly focuses on the investigation of the behavior of organic pollutants (pesticides, pharmaceuticals etc.) in soil (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.121298" target="_blank">J.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>Dr. Sunil was also associated with a number of international conferences and workshops organized by Prof. Aravindakumar’s group. He also played an important role in the installation of Ion Chromatography (IC), HPLC, low and high-resolution Mass Spectrometers (LC-MS & LC-Q-TOF), UV-Vis spectrometer etc. in the inter-university instrumentation center (IUIC) in which Prof. Aravindakumar acted as the Hon. Director.</tab1></p>
