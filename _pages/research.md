<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1><strong>Dr. Sunil</strong> is an experienced analytical and environmental chemist currently (since August 2023) working as a Scientist with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u7n2nsIAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Aki Sebastian Ruhl</a>’s research group at the <a href="https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en" target="_blank">German Environment Agency (UBA)</a> in Berlin, Germany. Within the Drinking Water Resources and Treatment section at UBA, his primary focus is on developing analytical methods to detect pharmaceuticals and other emerging organic contaminants in water.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>Dr. Sunil’s passion for analytical chemistry began shortly after completing his Master’s degree at <a href="https://www.mgu.ac.in" target="_blank">Mahatma Gandhi University</a>, Kottayam, in 2008, when he joined the Quality Evaluation Laboratory at the <a href="http://www.indianspices.com" target="_blank">Spices Board of India</a> in Kochi, Kerala, as a trainee analyst. During this time, he worked on analyzing various spices and spice products to assess their quality using advanced analytical techniques such as High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Gas Chromatography (GC), Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS), and Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In 2010, following a national-level interview, he was selected as a project fellow funded by UGC-DAE CSR, Kolkata, to join the research group of <a href="http://www.ctamgu.in/home/" target="_blank">Prof. C. T. Aravindakumar</a> at the School of Environmental Sciences, Mahatma Gandhi University. The following year, he enrolled as a Ph.D. student at the same institute, marking the start of his doctoral research.</tab1></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>Dr. Sunil’s broad research interests encompass analytical chemistry, free radical chemistry, and environmental chemistry. Early in his Ph.D. journey, his focus was on mechanistic studies of environmentally and biologically relevant molecules—primarily pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs)—through free radical reactions. His work in this area includes kinetic and mechanistic investigations of the oxidative transformation of compounds such as Theophylline (<a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/-/content/articlehtml/2014/ob/c4ob00102h" target="_blank">Org. Biomol. Chem., 2014</a>), Diphenhydramine (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/slct.201600103/abstract" target="_blank">ChemistrySelect, 2016</a>), and Fensulfothion (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653512014385?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">Chemosphere, 2013</a>). These studies involved extensive use of time-resolved spectroscopic techniques alongside various chromatographic and mass spectrometric methods to identify unknown transformation products. In recognition of his contributions, his research was awarded the “Dr. Hari Mohan Memorial Award” for the best poster at the Trombay Symposium on Radiation and Photochemistry (TSRP 2014) held in Mumbai, India. Later that year, in October 2014, he was also honored with a Senior Research Fellowship (SRF) from the <a href="http://www.csir.res.in" target="_blank">Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)</a>, Government of India.</tab1></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>Dr. Sunil has also contributed to several collaborative research projects within Prof. Aravindakumar’s group. Notable collaborations include joint studies with <a href="http://pagesperso.lcp.u-psud.fr/belloni/" target="_blank">Prof. Jacqueline Belloni</a> from Université Paris-Sud, Orsay, France (<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/09553002.2014.899451" target="_blank">Int. J. Radiat. Biol., 2014</a>), and <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=CwkZd7AAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Mehmet A. Oturan</a> from Université Gustave Eiffel, Marne-la-Vallée, France (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-014-2772-4" target="_blank">Environ. Sci. Pollut. Res., 2014</a>; <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11356-017-9309-6" target="_blank">2017</a>). His primary role in these projects involved structural elucidation of transformation products derived from biologically significant molecules, such as hydroxy naphthoquinones and amino salicylic acids. Subsequently, he worked with <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=08XXzuEAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Olivier Laprévote</a> of Université Paris Cité, Paris, France, to develop an advanced mass spectrometry-based method for characterizing positional isomers formed during the oxidative transformation of the environmentally relevant bio-molecule diphenhydramine (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jms.3607/full" target="_blank">J. Mass Spectrom., 2015</a>).</tab1></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>The final phase of Dr. Sunil’s Ph.D. research focused on environmentally relevant transformations occurring in the ice phase. This work was carried out at <a href="http://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/" target="_blank">Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH)</a>, Republic of Korea, where he was an international visiting student (2014–2015) in the research group of <a href="https://epa.kentech.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Prof. Wonyong Choi</a>—currently a distinguished professor at the <a href="https://www.kentech.ac.kr/main.do" target="_blank">Korea Institute of Energy Technology (KENTECH)</a> and Editor-in-Chief of <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/journal/aeecco" target="_blank">ACS ES&T Engineering</a>. In September 2015, Dr. Sunil joined the same group as a Post-Doctoral Researcher to continue his studies on ice chemistry. His research primarily involved investigating the dissolution of environmentally important inorganic ions—such as lead (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.121298" target="_blank">J. Hazard. Mater., 2020</a>), iron (<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.8b04484" target="_blank">Environ. Sci. Technol., 2018</a>; <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.8b06659" target="_blank">2019</a>), chromium, and zinc—in the ice phase. Additionally, he explored the dark phase production of hydrogen peroxide and humic-like substances in ice, both of which play critical roles in environmental processes.</tab1></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>Dr. Sunil actively participated in numerous international conferences and workshops organized by Prof. Aravindakumar’s group. He also played a key role in the installation and setup of advanced instrumentation—including Ion Chromatography (IC), HPLC, low- and high-resolution mass spectrometers (LC-MS and LC-Q-TOF), and UV-Vis spectrometers—at the Inter-University Instrumentation Center (IUIC), where Prof. Aravindakumar served as Honorary Director.</tab1></p>
